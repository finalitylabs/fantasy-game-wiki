**_Decentraland Calculations:_**

Here we describe the contested battle arena as represented in 3D by the Decentraland client. This will need parcels of land to be owned and how much is calculated here. We should keep the number of contested keeps/strongholds to a finite N. N=1 is the simplest case and would require the least amount of land contested.

Current Max units of Parcels in DCL: 90,000 

Parcel area in meters: 10m x10m = 100 m^2

Genesis City area: 5592.34073 miles x 5592.34073 miles or 31,274,274.84 mi^2

(for reference the Earth is 196,600,000  mi^2, Genesis is ~16% of Earthâ€™s surface)

A futbal field is ~70m x 100m with an area of (70x100=7000m) so for simplicity we will imagine that (7000/100=70) parcels of DCL land is about one soccer field. With this kind of scale in mind we could do a lot with ~5000 parcels.
