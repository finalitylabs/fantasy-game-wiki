# Resource Mining

Players start off with a basic amount of units that mine a power resource called vok. Vok is used to buy more mining units, mining unit upgrades, attack and defense units, keep upgrades, and movement cost. Vok will be a mintable token that inflates and deflates. 

Idea: could what the Vok mine be represented visually in the game grid? For example, thereâ€™s a huge crack in the earth that the Vok climb down to gather energy and return to the surface with its bounty.

Current area of research. But early ideas here revolve around a decentralized generation process for NFTs in our game.
