# Story

## Idea 
You start on an island habituated by a basic village. A meteorite has crashed at the norther-most region of your island. Upon years of examining the rock, you've been able to use its magical energy to build a brand new civilization like the world as never known.

Why this story:
* your base is not physically located in the world, but rather acts as a "slotted bag" to place down a set number of buildings.
* allows for expanding the game later to discover a mainland or other islands

## Idea

You start out owning some metric of land on a resource depot, (NOTE: parcel of land in DCL(10m x 10x)).
