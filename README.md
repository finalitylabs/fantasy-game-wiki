### Game Name

Undecided

### Requirements

* Resource building of ERC20 fungible token - reference: https://ethergoo.io

* A DCL integration on LAND parcels for contested battle area (We will design this in a similar way as Genesis City)

* Cost Effective - (Plasma and State-Channels)

* Turn-based combat

* Limited real-time disputable interaction (limited by Plasma judge gas limit on Turing complete game logic)

* Under Consideration: mined creatures/items ERC721 (Mining protocol for discovering new units/items) reference:[https://mooncatrescue.com](https://mooncatrescue.com)

### Genre

* (Medieval Fantasy) Empire-building economy game

* Metaverse game

### Abstract

PLACEHOLDER is an expansive world where gamers will build a decentralized economy, discover rare units/items, and battle for control of strongholds and resources…. 

**Story and Player Agency:**

See [Story page](./Story.md) that covers story and who the player is

### Game Mechanics

**_Grid System_**

We are mapping (x,y) positional coordinates to units. 

**_Build System_**

Once the player buys a building, they can place it on a map grid. There is no strategic reason for placement other than visual appeal [for MVP].

Possibly player base attacks can cause buildings to require repair before resuming their purpose.

**_Battle System_**

See [battle systems](./Battle-Systems.md)

**_Resource Mining_**

See [resource mining](./Resource-Mining.md)

### Decentraland Battlegrounds

Visually this can look similar to World of Warcraft battleground maps.

### Blockchain and Economy systems
