**Game Mechanics**

**_Grid System_**

We are mapping (x,y) positional coordinates to units. 

**_Build System_**

Once the player buys a building, they can place it on a map grid. There is no strategic reason for placement other than visual appeal [for MVP].

Possibly player base attacks can cause buildings to require repair before resuming their purpose.

**_Battle System_**

**_Resource Mining_**

**Decentraland Battlegrounds**
