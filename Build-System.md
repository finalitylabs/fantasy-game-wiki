# Build System

### Grid System

We are mapping (x,y) positional coordinates to units. 

### Building

Once the player buys a building, they can place it on a map grid. There is no strategic reason for placement other than visual appeal [for MVP].

Possibly player base attacks can cause buildings to require repair before resuming their purpose.
