**Scalability Technology:**

**_Generalized State-Channels:_**

[https://github.com/SpankChain/general-state-channels](https://github.com/SpankChain/general-state-channels)

State-channels gives the game the ability to play turn based combat in a trustless way that also escrows ether, tokens, and units. Heroes will partake in state-channel based fights.

**_Plasma:_**

We will be building an application specific plasma chain to run the game logic so that transaction fees and consensus lag can be averted. This chain will have a judge contract on the mainnet that can detect illegal state transitions in PLACEHOLDER. This technology will be the first (known) plasma construct that is not bound UTXO based state.
